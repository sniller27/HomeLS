# HomeLS hybrid mobile app

This application is a hybrid mobile app made in IntelXDK with jQuery mobile.
The app is a prototype app for homeless people that provides different kinds of useful information. The app can detect places nearby where you can rest if you are homeless in Copenhagen, and tell you how far away you are from the different places. This is done by GPS as hybrid functionality.

The app gets its data from a MySQL database by using cross origin resource sharing in PHP which formats the data into JSON which is read by client with JavaScript and AJAX.

All the files in this project are generated by Intel XDK except getshelters.php, which create the returned JSON from the database. 
I have coded most of the files in the www/ folder.

The app can be download here(for Android): http://somethingsimple.dk/Projects/mobileapp/HomeLS/HomeLS/homels.cordova.crosswalk.201511052539-armv7.apk
